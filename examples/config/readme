  Browser Interaction with Client/Device applications

=======================================================

Node-M2M uses nodemon to restart client/device applications during node-m2m update, application code update, 
remote command restarting, etc. 

You can add the following section in your project's package.json as a basic auto restart configuration. 

  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon client.js --delay 2000ms"
  },
  "nodemonConfig": {
    "verbose": true,
    "restartable": "rs",
    "ignore": [".git", "public"],
    "ignoreRoot": [".git", "public"],
    "execMap": {"js": "node"},
    "watch": ["node_modules/m2m/mon"],
    "env": {"NODE_ENV": "development"},
    "ext": "js,json"
  }


Please check the corresponding client/device folders for an actual example of package.json for client/device application.
Just change the application filename from the 'start' property with the actual filename of your application.

For further details, please check nodemon documentation on how to configure nodemon along with npm package.json.
